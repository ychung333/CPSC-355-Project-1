The file for each algorithm 1 and 2 I made it seperately.

How to run Algorithm 1:

  Make sure both disks.py and main.py are in the same folder.
  Open a terminal/command prompt.
  Run the following command: 'python main.py' or 'python3 main.py'
  The program will display:
  Final arrangement of disks
  Total number of swaps performed

How to run Algorithm 2: Matching Group Schedules

  Open a terminal or command prompt.
  Navigate to the folder containing algo2.py.
  Run the program with:
  python3 algo2.py
  Follow the prompts or edit the sample input inside the file to test different schedules.

  Sample output: [['10:30', '12:00'], ['15:00', '16:00'], ['18:00', '18:30']]
