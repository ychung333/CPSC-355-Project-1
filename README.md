The file for each algorithm 1 and 2 I made it seperately. 


How to run Algorithm 1:
1. Make sure both disks.py and main.py are in the same folder.
2. Open a terminal/command prompt.
3. Run the following command:
   'python main.py' or 'python3 main.py'
4. The program will display:
   - Final arrangement of disks
   - Total number of swaps performed


How to run Algorithm 2: Matching Group Schedules

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.  
2. Navigate to the folder containing algo2.py.  
3. Run the program with:  
   python3 algo2.py  
4. Follow the prompts or edit the sample input inside the file to test different schedules.
